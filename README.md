# Bikesharing (Tableau)
In this module we have used Tableau to analyze Bikeshare Data in NYC

## Overview of our Analysis

The purpose of our project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for a different city(which the customer is requesting). One of the key factors we need to look at is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August will give us a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike. Before we do any of this there needs to be a change made in the csv to change the column that records the trip duration in seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. Once this was completed I uploaded the new CSV into tableau with the converted tripduration column.
